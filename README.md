# Mobistudy Web

This repository contains the frontend of the Mobistudy web server.
The frontend is developed as a single-page app using the [quasar framework](https://quasar-framework.org/).

## Pre requisites

You need to install the following on your system:

- nodejs
- (optional) the [quasar command line tool](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/installation)

Install all other dependencies with `npm install`.

## Run

To start the interface, run `npm run dev` or, if you have installed the quasar cli, `quasar dev`.
You will need the MobistudyAPI running in parallel (see MobistudyAPI README).

## Test

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

If you want to have quasar and the tests running in parallel and watching for code changes:

```bash
npm run concurrently:dev:jest
```

## Develop

The code is written mostly in ES6 and uses ES6 modules, please be consistent.
If you use VS Code, follow the [recommended settings from Quasar](https://quasar.dev/start/vs-code-configuration#Introduction).

## Deploy

Run `quasar build`. This will generate the material UI interfaces and make it available under `./dist/`


## Docker

This only explains how to build and run the Docker instance of this project.
For the full setup including database and web interface, see the
[Wiki](https://github.com/Mobistudy/MobistudyAPI/wiki/Docker-setup).

Build the docker instance:
```bash
docker build -t mobistudyweb .
```

Then run it with:
```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name mobistudyweb mobistudyweb
```

This will launch an ngnix instance that serves the static content, but not the API.
You will need the API running as well!
